                    GNU-STYLE NON-COMMERCIAL COPYLEFT LICENSE
================================================================================

PREAMBLE

The Glera-General-Public-Creative-License (GGPCL) is a free, copyleft license 
for software and other kinds of works, designed to ensure your freedom to share 
and change all versions of a program while prohibiting commercial exploitation, 
illegal activities, and military/harmful applications.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom to use and modify, 
not price. Our Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to 
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish, as long as 
it's non-commercial), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, 
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and 
that you know you can do these things - but NEVER for commercial gain, illegal 
purposes, or harmful applications.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights 
or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities 
if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities 
to respect the freedom of others and to maintain the non-commercial, peaceful, 
and legal nature of the software.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or not, 
you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must 
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. You must ensure 
that they understand that the software is for non-commercial use only, must not 
be used for illegal activities, and must not be used for military or harmful 
purposes. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights and 
restrictions.

Developers that use the GGPCL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert 
copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal 
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it, subject to the terms herein.

1. GRANT OF LICENSE

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the copyright holder hereby 
grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual license to use, 
copy, modify, merge, publish, and distribute the Program and derivative works, 
provided that:

  a) Such use is strictly for Non-Commercial Use only
  b) Such use is not for Illegal Activities
  c) Such use is not for Military Applications
  d) Such use is not for Harmful Purposes
  e) All derivative works are licensed under this same GGPCL License

2. SOURCE CODE REQUIREMENTS

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, 
in any medium, provided that you:

  a) Conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright 
     notice
  b) Keep intact all notices stating that this License applies to the code
  c) Keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty
  d) Give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program
  e) Clearly state that the Program is for Non-Commercial Use only

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. You must ensure that source code is available under the 
same terms as the Program itself.

3. COPYLEFT: MODIFICATIONS AND DERIVATIVE WORKS

You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus 
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications 
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of 
these conditions:

  a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that 
     you changed the files and the date of any change.

  b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in 
     part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be 
     licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of 
     this License.

  c) You must make the source code of the modified version available under the 
     same terms as the original Program.

  d) You must retain all copyright notices, license notices, and disclaimers from 
     the original Program.

  e) You must clearly indicate that the work is a modified version and identify 
     yourself as the modifier.

  f) You must not remove or alter the GGPCL license from any derivative work - 
     all modifications and derivative works MUST remain under the GGPCL License.

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections 
of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered 
independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, 
do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But 
when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based 
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License.

4. PROHIBITION OF COMMERCIAL USE

SELLING THE PROGRAM OR ANY DERIVATIVE WORK IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

You may NOT:
  - Sell the Program or any derivative work for money or any other consideration
  - Charge fees for access to the Program or derivative works
  - Use the Program or derivative works in any commercial product or service
  - Integrate the Program into any product or service that is sold
  - Use the Program to provide paid services
  - Use the Program in any business operation that generates revenue

This prohibition applies regardless of how the commercial activity is structured, 
including but not limited to: direct sales, subscription services, freemium models, 
advertising-supported services, or any other revenue-generating mechanism.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy (such as media 
costs), but you may not charge for the software itself.

5. PROHIBITION OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES

You may NOT use the Program or any derivative work for any Illegal Activities, 
including but not limited to:
  - Activities that violate criminal law
  - Unauthorized access to computer systems or networks
  - Copyright or intellectual property infringement (except as permitted by law)
  - Distribution of illegal content
  - Money laundering or financial fraud
  - Drug trafficking or other contraband
  - Any other activity prohibited by applicable law

6. PROHIBITION OF MILITARY AND HARMFUL USE

You may NOT use the Program or any derivative work for:

  a) MILITARY APPLICATIONS: Including but not limited to weapons systems, 
     military command and control systems, military logistics, military training 
     simulations, defense systems, or any other military-related purpose.

  b) HARMFUL PURPOSES: Including but not limited to:
     - Creating or distributing malware, viruses, ransomware, or spyware
     - Unauthorized surveillance or tracking
     - Facilitating harassment, stalking, or intimidation
     - Enabling discrimination based on protected characteristics
     - Creating deepfakes or other deceptive media without consent
     - Facilitating human rights violations
     - Any use that causes harm to individuals or society

This is a PACIFIST LICENSE. The Program may not be used for warfare, violence, 
or causing harm to others.

7. NO WARRANTY

BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE 
PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED 
IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" 
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT 
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH 
YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY 
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY 
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS 
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE 
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED 
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE 
PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY 
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

9. AUTOMATIC LICENSING OF DOWNSTREAM RECIPIENTS

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a 
license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, 
subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by 
third parties with this License.

However, you must ensure that recipients are aware of the terms of this License 
and understand that:
  - The Program is for Non-Commercial Use only
  - Commercial use is prohibited
  - Illegal activities are prohibited
  - Military applications are prohibited
  - Harmful purposes are prohibited
  - All derivative works must remain under the GGPCL License

10. TERMINATION

You may not propagate or modify the Program except as expressly provided under 
this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will 
automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a 
particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until 
the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) 
permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by 
some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Termination of your rights under this Section does not terminate the licenses of 
parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.

11. ACCEPTANCE NOT REQUIRED FOR HAVING COPIES

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of 
the Program. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to 
propagate or modify the Program. These actions infringe copyright if you do not 
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating the Program, you 
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions.

12. AUTOMATIC LICENSING OF DOWNSTREAM USERS

Each time you distribute or convey the Program or a derivative work, the recipient 
automatically receives a license from the original copyright holder to use, copy, 
distribute, and modify the Program, subject to the terms and conditions of this 
License. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise 
of the rights granted herein, except for the restrictions already present in this 
License.

13. PATENTS

If you convey the Program, you grant recipients a patent license for any patents 
you hold that are necessarily infringed by the Program. This patent license is 
limited to Non-Commercial Use only and is subject to all other restrictions in 
this License.

14. NO SURRENDER OF FREEDOM

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) 
that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the 
conditions of this License. If you cannot convey the Program so as to satisfy 
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.

15. INTERPRETATION

If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall 
be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. The remaining 
provisions of this License shall remain in full force and effect.

16. GOVERNING LAW

This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of 
Germany, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

17. REVISED VERSIONS OF THIS LICENSE

Niklas Legler may publish revised and/or new versions of the Glera-General-Public-
Creative-License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to 
the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies 
that a certain numbered version of the GGPCL "or any later version" applies to it, 
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered 
version or of any later version published by Niklas Legler. If the Program does 
not specify a version number of the GGPCL, you may choose any version ever 
published by Niklas Legler.

This is the Glera-General-Public-Creativ-License (GGPCL) Version 1.0.

The GGPCL is a free, copyleft license for software that ensures freedom to share 
and modify while prohibiting commercial use, illegal activities, military 
applications, and harmful purposes.

Unlike the GNU GPL which allows commercial use, the GGPCL is designed for those 
who want to share their work freely for non-commercial, peaceful, and legal 
purposes only.
